# TODO

These are some improvements needed to the docs, including this list itself :)

## Design

This section are items that help improve the look and feel. Examples of other documentation [1](https://stripe.com/docs/api#intro), [2](https://github.com/PharkMillups/beautiful-docs)

- [ ] Syntax highlighting of html code snippets ([example](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#forms-example))
- [ ] Better Logo
- [ ] Color theme

## Structural

- [ ] Decide on a solid outline structure (the left menu)
      This would inform the url, i.e. http://katychuang.com/try-reflex-docs/#buttons


## Content

### Static Elements

- [ ] fill out the examples outlined
- [ ] add more, (see section 4 of TOC [here](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/) for list of all available HTML5elements)

### Dynamic Elements

- Behaviors and Events...

### Best Practices

- Installation Guide
- General advice and tips
- Trouble shooting tips
- Stats and Usage Reports

#### Collaboration Channels

For now, discussion via email and the IRC #reflex-frp channel. There was a suggestion for using [gitter](https://gitter.im/)
